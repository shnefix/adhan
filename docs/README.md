## Recommended Reading Order

For someone learning native Android development or exploring this codebase for the first time, follow this reading path:

| Order | Document | Purpose & Summary |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | [Project Overview](PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) | Understand the high-level mission, core requirements, constraints (no GPS, no cloud, Tunisian calculation), and design goals. |
| **2** | [Tech Stack](TECH_STACK.md) | Explore every tool, plugin, library, and framework chosen for this project and the technical justification for each. |
| **3** | [Build and Gradle](BUILD_AND_GRADLE.md) | **Crucial foundational step**: Learn what Gradle is, how the Gradle Wrapper works, what `assembleDebug` executes, version catalogs, and how caching works. |
| **4** | [Project Structure](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) | A complete tour of the directory hierarchy, files, and where UI, domain, data, and configuration live. |
| **5** | [Android Fundamentals](ANDROID_FUNDAMENTALS.md) | Master Android fundamentals: Application class, Activity lifecycle, Context, Manifest, Intent system, and permission model. |
| **6** | [Kotlin Fundamentals](KOTLIN_FUNDAMENTALS.md) | Understand Kotlin language features used in our codebase: coroutines, Flow, sealed interfaces, data classes, and extension functions. |
| **7** | [Jetpack Compose & UI](JETPACK_COMPOSE.md) | Modern declarative UI: composables, state management, recomposition, Material 3, theming, and layout mechanics. |
| **8** | [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) | MVVM architecture, unidirectional data flow (UDF), domain boundaries, and data layer separation. |
| **9** | [Data and Persistence](DATA_AND_PERSISTENCE.md) | Room database, DAOs, entities, migrations, DataStore, and persistent user preferences. |
| **10** | [Prayer Time Calculation](PRAYER_TIME_CALCULATION.md) | Solar astronomy, Tunisian official calculation conventions, equation of time, solar depression angles, and validation against official timetables. |
| **11** | [Alarms and Notifications](ALARMS_AND_NOTIFICATIONS.md) | The heart of Prayer Alarm: AlarmManager, exact alarm semantics, broadcast receivers, notification channels, battery optimizations, and boot recovery. |
| **12** | [Testing and Debugging](TESTING_AND_DEBUGGING.md) | Unit tests, Android test harness, Logcat debugging, and verifying schedules on real devices. |
| **13** | [Decisions and Tradeoffs](DECISIONS_AND_TRADEOFFS.md) | Engineering decision log explaining why specific paths were chosen and alternatives rejected. |
| **14** | [Learning Notes](LEARNING_NOTES.md) | Revision notebook: confusing concepts simplified, common pitfalls to avoid, and key takeaways. |
| **15** | [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) | Step-by-step progress tracking each development stage. |

## Documentation Standards

Every document in this directory adheres to strict educational and technical standards:
1. **Accurate to Real Code**: All paths, function names, and Gradle versions correspond to the real files in the repository.
2. **Deep Concept Breakdowns**: Concepts are explained with **What**, **Why**, **How**, **Where it appears**, **Code examples**, **Common mistakes**, **Alternatives**, and **Revision questions**.
3. **No Phantom Claims**: Features and tests are marked according to their real status (`Implemented & Verified`, `In Progress`, or `Planned`).
